# ATenNN Subcomponents

This directory contains specialized agent definitions for ATenNN neural network architectures.

## Agents

### ATenNN-RNN
**Recurrent Neural Networks Agent** - Implements sequence modeling architectures including RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and bidirectional variants for temporal processing and language understanding.

### ATenNN-GNN
**Graph Neural Networks Agent** - Implements neural architectures that operate on graph structures, including message passing networks, graph convolutions, and attention mechanisms for learning on AtomSpace hypergraphs.

## Integration

These agents provide specialized neural architectures:
- **RNN** handles sequential and temporal data (language, time series, working memory)
- **GNN** learns directly on graph structures (AtomSpace, scene graphs, relational reasoning)

Together with the main ATenNN framework, they enable the full spectrum of neural network architectures needed for cognitive processing.
